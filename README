This is a small repository that provides the minimal usable pieces needed to estimate virtual tractography 
for patients of stroke who have experienced white matter injury. The necessary first effort needs to be to create
lesion masks for each patient that is transformed into the MNI space. Using that and the data in baseData.mat you can create
virtual structural connectomes for patients. Read the corresponding paper for more details:
